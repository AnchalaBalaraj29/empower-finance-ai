 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Traditional financial AI tools often operate as black boxes. In this project, we integrate:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on financial data
- Explainable AI (XAI) methods for transparency
- Personalization to adapt responses to individual user profiles

Our goal is to empower users with trustworthy, understandable, and tailored financial insights.
